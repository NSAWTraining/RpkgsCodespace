# R pkgs Codespace

Repo set up for using Codespaces while developing R packages. This should have all the tools you need to develop an R package!

If you don't need to save your changes, follow the [instructions to create a codespace](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/creating-a-codespace-for-a-repository#creating-a-codespace-for-a-repository). 

If you do need to save your changes, click "use this template" first to make your own repository with the same structure, then follow the [instructions to create a codespace](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/creating-a-codespace-for-a-repository#creating-a-codespace-for-a-repository).

After creating the codespace, additional R packages can be installed by opening the R console and using `install.packages`
